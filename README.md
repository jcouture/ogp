  OGP is a minimalist Ruby library that does only one thing: parse Open Graph protocol information. For more information: <a href="http://ogp.me">http://ogp.me</a>.

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ogp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ogp

## Usage

In order to keep OGP very simple, it does not perform any HTTP operations. As such, in this example, [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) is used to achieve this functionality.

```ruby
require 'faraday'
require 'ogp'

response = Faraday.get('http://ogp.me')

open_graph = OGP::OpenGraph.new(response.body)
open_graph.title # => "Open Graph protocol"
open_graph.type # => "website"
open_graph.image.url # => "http://ogp.me/logo.png"
open_graph.url # => "http://ogp.me/"

# All open graph tags are additionally stored in a `data` hash so that custom
# open graph tags can still be accessed.
open_graph.data["title"] # => "Open Graph protocol"
```
